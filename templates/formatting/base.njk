## Formatting Requirements:

### Markdown Usage:
- Use proper markdown formatting for headers, lists, and code blocks
- Ensure consistent indentation and spacing
- Use code blocks with appropriate language tags for code snippets
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for multiple items

### Structure:
- Use clear section headers when organizing complex information
- Keep paragraphs concise and focused on single topics
- Use line breaks appropriately to improve readability
- Maintain consistent formatting style throughout

### Code References:
- Use backticks for inline code references (function names, variables, etc.)
- In inline review comments, prefer GitHub suggestion blocks (```suggestion) for concrete code changes; ensure patches are minimal and accurate
- Do not include code blocks or specific code suggestions in the top-level review summary
- Include file paths and line numbers only within inline comments (not in the summary)
- Use proper syntax highlighting when showing code examples

### Links and References:
- Use descriptive link text rather than raw URLs
- Reference specific files, functions, or components by name
- Include relevant issue numbers or ticket references when applicable
